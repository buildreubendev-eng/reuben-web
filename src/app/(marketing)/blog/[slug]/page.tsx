        <p>
          PLOS is no longer just a long-range consumer simulation idea. The first MVP foundation is live as a standalone Next.js app for Reuben&apos;s Personal Life Operating System.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current product slice focuses on personal life admin: bills, renewals, appointments, travel confirmations, receipts, important documents, deadlines, subscriptions, and messages that need a reply. The app turns those inputs into a prioritized dashboard, AI Inbox, generated tasks, weekly briefing, documents, and a Life Admin Score.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend foundation is already in place with typed routes for items, tasks, dashboard summaries, recommendations, approvals, raw ingestion, documents, settings, integrations, audit history, and local reset. Sensitive actions such as sending messages, making payments, or canceling subscriptions are routed through approval gates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Real Gmail, Calendar, bank, and health integrations are intentionally not connected yet. The MVP uses realistic mock data and abstraction layers so those permission-based integrations can be added later without rebuilding the product core.
        </p>
        <p>
          LifePilot was the working codename. The user-facing product is PLOS.

        <p>
          Today we are opening up the <strong>Business Simulator</strong>, a live demonstration of the Reux engine forecasting margins and risk based on operational inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reux is a domain-specific programming language designed specifically for the complex logic that underpins data-aware products. Over the past few months, we have built a working compiler, CLI, and integration layer that allows Next.js frontend applications to seamlessly pass inputs into Reux and receive strongly-typed responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try the simulator today to see how we evaluate multiple scenarios, generate forecasts, and assign risk scores under the hood.

    content: (

        <p>
          Most web applications struggle with complex business rules. They start simple, but as requirements grow, state changes and decision logic become scattered across frontend components, API handlers, and database triggers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe there is a better way. By extracting this logic into Reux, a specialized backend language, we can provide built-in primitives for scenarios, forecasts, dimensions, and objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensures that the rules of the game are always auditable, testable, and separate from your presentation layer.
