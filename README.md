# Reuben Web - Frontend

The public website for the Reuben ecosystem: homepage, project pages, Business Simulator, PLOS positioning, developer preview, and marketing pages.

Built with **Next.js 16**, React, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` | For live demo | URL of the hosted Reux pilot demo service. When unset, the simulator falls back to the local mock engine. |
| `CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL` | For real intake | Optional webhook URL for pilot/contact leads. Use a Zapier, Make, Slack-compatible, or custom webhook endpoint. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | For email intake | Optional Resend API key for contact email delivery. |
| `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` | For email intake | Destination inbox for contact leads when using Resend. |
| `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` | For email intake | Verified sender address for Resend. Defaults to Resend onboarding sender if unset. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Fallback | Public email address used by the contact form's mail fallback when no server delivery is configured. |

**Production value:**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL=https://reux-pilot-demo-production.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL=buildreuben.dev@gmail.com
```

Do not include a trailing slash.

## Key Routes

Check these before each deployment:

| Route | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Homepage | Primary CTA to Simulator |
| `/simulator` | Simulator dashboard | Lists saved simulations, shows intro |
| `/simulator/new` | Scenario builder | Input validation mirrors backend limits |
| `/simulator/[id]` | Simulation results | Charts, metrics, recommendation |
| `/simulator/[id]/compare` | Scenario comparison | Side-by-side charts and table |
| `/projects` | All projects | Grouped by status: Live / Prototype / MVP / Next |
| `/projects/reux` | Reux product page | Features, pilots, roadmap summary |
| `/projects/reux/roadmap` | Full roadmap | Available Now / Beta / Next / Future |
| `/projects/reux/demo` | Live Reux demos | Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` |
| `/operator/pilot-requests` | Founder Pilot operator view | Requires the Railway demo admin token |
| `/projects/plos` | PLOS product page | MVP foundation, backend surface, privacy model, and next milestone |
| `/docs` | Developer preview | Onboarding steps, syntax examples, editor support, run-from-source |
| `/about` | About Reuben | Vision, ecosystem diagram, team |

## Developer Preview

The `/docs` page provides a structured onboarding path for technical users who want to try Reux locally:

1. Clone the [Reux repo](https://github.com/buildreubendev-eng/Reux)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run onboarding:smoke` — proves the compiler, CLI, and simulation runner work locally (no database needed)
4. Install the VS Code extension from `editors/vscode/`
5. Run a simulation example

The public npm package and VS Code Marketplace listing are not yet available. See the [roadmap](/projects/reux/roadmap) for current status.

## PLOS Status

PLOS is now treated as an MVP foundation, not a placeholder future product. The product repo currently includes:

- Life-admin dashboard, AI Inbox simulation, generated tasks, weekly briefing, documents, approvals, integrations, ingest, audit, and settings surfaces.
- Backend routes for items, tasks, recommendations, dashboard, briefing, documents, settings, integrations, audit, approvals, ingestion, and reset.
- Privacy-first behavior: no real Gmail, Calendar, bank, or health integrations yet, and sensitive actions require explicit approval.
- Local JSON persistence for the MVP plus a Prisma SQLite schema for the next repository implementation milestone.

The public website should describe LifePilot only as the old working codename. The user-facing product name is PLOS.

## Simulator API Limits

The frontend mirrors these backend constraints locally in `src/lib/simulation/constants.ts` to provide immediate validation feedback:

- **Max run scenarios:** 8
- **Max compare scenarios:** 12
- **Max forecast periods:** 52
- **Max timeline points:** 52
- **Scenario ID max:** 64 characters
- **Scenario name max:** 120 characters
- **Scenario description max:** 500 characters
- **Scenario ID regex:** `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`

## Build & Lint

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Both must pass before merging to main.

## Browser E2E

Install the Playwright browser once after a fresh dependency install:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Then run the simulator browser flow:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:simulator
```

The E2E test starts the local Next.js dev server, opens Chromium, creates a simulation, verifies the results page, recommendation panel, chart/table surfaces, and confirms the scenario comparison table renders.

## Live Demo Smoke Check

After Vercel deploys, run:

```bash
npm run check:live-demo
```

The smoke check verifies:

- The homepage, Reux project page, docs, roadmap, and simulator start path expose the right first-visitor CTAs.
- `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/simulator` serves the public simulator and Reux model catalog.
- `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/projects/reux/demo` links visitors into the Business Simulator.
- The Railway demo service reports healthy executable Reux models.
- `operations_decision` executes through the Reux API.
- The Business Simulator adapter creates a saved run, reloads it by ID, and lists it in the current visitor session.

Override targets when testing preview deploys:

```bash
node scripts/check-live-demo.mjs --site https://your-preview.vercel.app --api https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app
```

## Public Demo Handoff

The Business Simulator is intended to be shareable with non-technical visitors at:

- `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/simulator`
- `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/simulator/new`

Before sending the link publicly, confirm:

- Vercel production has `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` set to the Railway backend URL.
- `/simulator` shows `Live Connected`, not `Local Mock`.
- `/simulator/new` loads all four templates without an admin token or login.
- A guided demo run creates a results page with recommendation, charts, Reux transparency, and a copyable saved-run link.
- `npm run check:live-demo` passes against production.

Visitor-facing behavior:

- The demo uses sample assumptions only.
- Saved run links are temporary and can expire.
- Users can share a re-runnable config link even if a saved run expires.
- The Founder Pilot form is the conversion path for real business data or custom pilots.
- Operators can review submitted leads at `/operator/pilot-requests` with the Railway demo admin token.

Lead handling checklist: [Founder Pilot Delivery Playbook](docs/founder-pilot-delivery.md).

## Operator Pilot Requests

**Route:** `/operator/pilot-requests`

Internal view for reviewing and triaging Founder Pilot leads submitted through the Business Simulator.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` | Must point to the Railway demo service |
| Admin token | The `REUX_DEMO_SETUP_TOKEN` value from the Railway service environment |

### Features

- **Lead list** — All pilot requests from the Railway backend, sorted by submission date.
- **Lead status** — Track each request as New → Contacted → Scoping → Closed. Persisted through the Reux backend operator API.
- **Operator notes** — Free-text notes per request, saved through the Reux backend operator API.
- **Copy Reply** — Generates a professional reply email template with the contact's name, challenge, and suggested next steps. Copies to clipboard.
- **Copy Summary** — Generates a Markdown summary with request ID, contact info, challenge, status, and notes. Copies to clipboard.
- **Improved error states** — Auth errors reference `REUX_DEMO_SETUP_TOKEN`; network errors reference `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL`.

### Operator API

- Lead workflow updates use `PATCH /api/pilot-requests/:id/operator`.
- The request body accepts `status`, `notes`, or both.
- Valid statuses are `new`, `contacted`, `scoping`, and `closed`.

Production verification shortcut:

```bash
npm run check:production
```

## Railway Deployment

This repo includes `railway.json`. Create a Railway service from `buildreubendev-eng/reuben-web` and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` variable.

## Architecture Notes

- **Marketing pages** live under `src/app/(marketing)/` with a shared layout.
- **Simulator pages** live under `src/app/simulator/` with a separate sidebar layout.
- **Simulation logic** is in `src/lib/simulation/` - see the [simulation README](src/lib/simulation/README.md) for the API contract.
- The simulator uses a **live-first, mock-fallback** pattern: it tries the real Reux backend first, and falls back to a local engine when the backend is unavailable.
