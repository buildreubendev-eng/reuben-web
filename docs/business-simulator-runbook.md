# Business Simulator Operational Runbook

This runbook is for keeping the public Business Simulator demo deliverable and safe to share.

For the customer-delivery process after a request arrives, use the [Founder Pilot Delivery Playbook](founder-pilot-delivery.md).

## Production URLs

| Surface | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Reuben website | `https://reuben-web.vercel.app` | Public marketing site and simulator frontend |
| Ecosystem status | `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/status` | Current Reux, Business Simulator, and PLOS status |
| Business Simulator | `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/simulator` | Public demo entry point |
| Scenario builder | `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/simulator/new` | Public template/scenario builder |
| Founder Pilot operator view | `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/operator/pilot-requests` | Internal lead review view |
| Reux backend | `https://reux-pilot-demo-production.up.railway.app` | Railway API used by the public demo |
| Backend health | `https://reux-pilot-demo-production.up.railway.app/api/health` | API health and executable model check |

## Required Production Configuration

Vercel must have:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL=https://reux-pilot-demo-production.up.railway.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL=buildreuben.dev@gmail.com
```

Rules:

- Do not include a trailing slash.
- Set it for Production and Preview if preview deploys should use the live backend.
- If this value is missing, the simulator intentionally falls back to local mock data and the header shows `Local Mock`.

Contact intake should have at least one of these configured:

```env
CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-intake-webhook.example.com
```

or:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=...
CONTACT_TO_EMAIL=you@example.com
CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL=Reuben <hello@yourdomain.com>
```

If neither server-side intake option is configured, or if configured delivery fails, the contact form opens a prefilled email draft using `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`.

The simulator Founder Pilot panels submit directly to the Railway `/api/pilot-requests` endpoint when `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` is configured. Until a branded sending domain is verified in Resend, Railway should keep:

```env
REUX_PILOT_REQUEST_FALLBACK_EMAIL=buildreuben.dev@gmail.com
```

That keeps the visible pilot request forms working through a prepared email handoff.

Railway must have:

- A healthy Reux backend service.
- A healthy PostgreSQL service attached to the backend.
- The backend service able to reach `DATABASE_URL`.
- The business simulation schema/migrations applied.
- `operations_decision` available in `/api/health` and `/api/reux/simulations`.

## Before Sharing the Demo Link

Run these from the repo root:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:e2e:simulator
npm run check:production
```

Then manually confirm:

- `/simulator` shows `Live Connected`, not `Local Mock`.
- `/status` clearly shows Reux as prototype complete, Business Simulator as the live sellable wedge, PLOS as the MVP foundation, and the live system check.
- `/simulator/new` loads all four templates.
- A guided demo can run without login, admin token, or private data.
- The result page shows recommendation, forecast chart, scenario comparison, Reux transparency, and the Founder Pilot request form.
- The `/projects/reux/demo` page shows the Founder Pilot request form below the embedded demo.
- Submitting the Founder Pilot form either returns a Railway request ID or opens a prepared email to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`.
- `/operator/pilot-requests` loads submitted leads when the Railway demo admin token is entered.

## Deployment Checklist

1. Push to `main`.
2. Wait for the Vercel production deployment to finish.
3. Open `https://reuben-web.vercel.app/simulator`.
4. Confirm the backend status badge says `Live Connected`.
5. Run `npm run check:production`.
6. Run one browser demo:
   - Open `/simulator/new?preset=optimization`.
   - Run the simulation.
   - Copy the saved result link.
   - Open the result link in a new tab.
   - Submit the Founder Pilot form and verify the success state or prepared email handoff.

## Smoke Check Details

`npm run check:production` verifies:

- Website routes render and contain expected demo CTAs.
- The `/status`, `/projects/plos`, `/blog/plos-mvp-foundation-live`, and `/privacy` pages preserve the current PLOS MVP positioning and privacy posture.
- The `/status` live system check can reach the configured Reux backend and model catalog in production.
- The Railway API health endpoint responds.
- Reux simulation catalog includes executable models.
- `operations_decision` can run through the Reux API.
- Business Simulator saved-run creation works.
- Saved-run reload works.
- Recent run listing works for the current demo session.
- Founder Pilot intake accepts a smoke request through Railway.
- Contact intake route is online and filters honeypot spam without delivery.

To test a preview deployment:

```bash
node scripts/check-live-demo.mjs --site https://your-preview.vercel.app --api https://your-railway-service.up.railway.app
```

## Expected Public Behavior

- Public users can run the demo without an account.
- Public users do not need an admin token.
- Templates use sample assumptions only.
- Saved result links are temporary.
- Configuration links remain useful even if a saved run expires.
- Founder Pilot forms are the conversion path for real business data.
- Founder Pilot requests should be handled with the [Founder Pilot Delivery Playbook](founder-pilot-delivery.md).
- The operator view is for internal review only and should not be linked from public navigation.

## Common Failure Modes

### Website Shows `Local Mock`

Likely cause:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` is missing or wrong in Vercel.

Fix:

1. Open Vercel project settings.
2. Confirm `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` exists for the active environment.
3. Confirm value is `https://reux-pilot-demo-production.up.railway.app`.
4. Redeploy the website.
5. Run `npm run check:production`.

### Website Shows `Backend Fallback`

Likely causes:

- Railway backend is offline.
- Railway backend health endpoint is failing.
- Database is unavailable.
- Network check timed out.

Fix:

1. Open Railway project.
2. Confirm backend service is online.
3. Open backend logs.
4. Confirm PostgreSQL service is online.
5. Open `/api/health`.
6. Redeploy backend if needed.
7. Run `npm run check:production`.

### Saved Runs Do Not Reload

Likely causes:

- Backend saved-run storage is unavailable.
- Demo session header behavior changed.
- Saved run expired.

Fix:

1. Run `npm run check:production`.
2. Confirm the `business simulator saved run` and `saved run reload` checks.
3. If only old links fail, create a fresh run and use the new link.
4. If fresh links fail, check Railway logs for `/api/simulation-runs`.

### Templates Load but Runs Fail

Likely causes:

- Backend validation contract changed.
- `operations-decision` template IDs drifted.
- Assumption names no longer match the API.

Fix:

1. Run `npm run test:e2e:simulator`.
2. Run `npm run check:production`.
3. Check recent commits touching `src/lib/simulation/api-client.ts`, `src/lib/simulation/templates.ts`, or backend simulation schemas.
4. Align frontend request shape with backend validation errors.

### Contact Form Does Not Deliver

Likely causes:

- No `CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL` is configured.
- Resend environment variables are missing or invalid.
- `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` is not a verified sender.
- The webhook endpoint is down.

Expected public behavior:

- Visitors should still see the prefilled email fallback if server-side delivery does not confirm.
- Validation errors should stay in the form and should not open the fallback.

Fix:

1. Confirm at least one intake path is configured in Vercel.
2. If using webhook delivery, test the webhook URL from the provider dashboard.
3. If using Resend, confirm `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`, and `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`.
4. Submit a test form from `/contact`.
5. Run `npm run check:production` to confirm the intake route itself is online.

### Founder Pilot Form Does Not Submit

Likely causes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` is missing or wrong in Vercel.
- Railway `/api/pilot-requests` is unavailable.
- Railway write rate limits are exhausted.
- CORS settings no longer allow the website origin.

Expected public behavior:

- Visitors should see the Founder Pilot form on `/simulator`, `/simulator/[id]`, and `/projects/reux/demo`.
- If Railway accepts the request without Resend configured, the visitor should see a prepared email handoff to `buildreuben.dev@gmail.com`.

Fix:

1. Open Railway `/api/health` and confirm `pilotRequests.fallbackEmail` is `buildreuben.dev@gmail.com`.
2. Run `npm run check:production`.
3. Submit a manual test from `/projects/reux/demo`.
4. Confirm the response creates a Railway pilot request ID or opens the prepared email.
5. If the request is accepted, handle the lead using the [Founder Pilot Delivery Playbook](founder-pilot-delivery.md).

### Operator View Cannot Load Leads

Likely causes:

- The entered token does not match Railway `REUX_DEMO_SETUP_TOKEN`.
- The Railway backend has not redeployed the pilot-request listing endpoint.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` is missing in Vercel.
- Browser CORS preflight is blocked by Railway CORS settings.

Fix:

1. Confirm `/api/health` shows the expected Railway build.
2. Confirm the same token works for demo setup/admin actions.
3. Open `/operator/pilot-requests`.
4. Enter the Railway demo admin token and click `Load`.
5. If it fails with `403`, rotate or re-copy `REUX_DEMO_SETUP_TOKEN`.
6. If it fails with a network error, confirm Railway CORS allows `x-reux-demo-token`.

## Quick Incident Checklist

When the public demo is not working:

1. Is Vercel production deployed successfully?
2. Is `NEXT_PUBLIC_REUX_DEMO_URL` set correctly?
3. Does `/simulator` show `Live Connected`?
4. Does Railway `/api/health` return `ok: true`?
5. Does `npm run check:production` pass?
6. Does a fresh guided demo run from `/simulator/new?preset=optimization`?
7. If not, check Railway logs first, then frontend adapter changes.
